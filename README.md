# Github, git, and version control.

Github is a public repository of code that allows users to store and/or publish code for sharing between individuals and as a way to establish version control and code backups. Version control is a practice that allows users and developers to track the changes of code as it is being developed, so that previous versions of code and the changes made can be documented. Git is a software that is used to communicate between GitHub and your system, and allows the user to push code to GitHub from their end-point that will be tracked for changes. This allows groups of people to work on the same code without having to document and explain every change through other communication methods. It also allows you to revert back to previous versions of code, if a mistake was made. To communicate between GitHub and your end-point, you will need to establish a secure connection. To do that, we will generate Secure Shell "ssh" key pairs to allow secure communication between your system and GitHub. This ssh is a protocol that allows clients (you) to communicate with servers (GitHub) without having to go through tedious security measures. They keys that are generated will be public and private. Never share your keys, especially your private key. 

Once the setup is complete, we will clone the ViCAT repo, and begin making changes so that we can implement the code on our systems.

## Instructions for Installing Git and Generating SSH Keys.

1.	HPC systems usually come pre-installed with Git so installation on the HPC is not necessary.
2.	For local users detailed installation instructions can be found here: [git installation](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
3. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
4. Check if you have any SSH key pairs already generated by opening a Terminal (Mac). ![Terminal Icon](/Users/cory/Desktop/git_instructions/terminal.png) Run
```cd ~/.ssh/```, and then ```ls``` to list files in the directory.
5. If you have a public key, copy it to your clipboard by opening the public key in a text editor. For example the key may be called ```id_ed25519.pub``` and to open it you can use vim ``` vi ./id_ed25519.pub```.
6. Navigate back to your github repo and click on the profile icon at the upper right corner of a page. ![Profile](/Users/cory/Desktop/git_instructions/GitHub_profile.png)

7. In the drop down menu, select settings.

8. In the settings page, go to the SSH and GPG keys page.

9. Click "New SSH key".

10. Input a Title that will allow you to remember which key belongs to which computer. This will allow you to push new code from your computer or system, to your own GitHub repo for version control of code you may wish to develop.
11. Paste the key that you copied earlier into the key box, and add the key.
12. If you do not have a key pair generated, you will need to add a key.
13. To generate a key, go to Terminal.
14. Run ```ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@email.com"```
15. Go to steps 4 - 11 after your key is generated.

## Cloning ViCAT Repo

1. Go to ViCAT's GitHub [Repo](https://github.com/coryVkeith/ViCAT_dev)

2. Click the drop-down arrow on the green "Code" box, select HTTPS, and then copy the link to your clipboard.

![Clone Repo](/Users/cory/Desktop/git_instructions/clone.png)

3. After you have copied the clone link, go back to terminal.
4. In your terminal, navigate to the location where you would like the repo. For example, the project that you would like to utilize ViCAT. ```cd usr/project```
5. From inside the directory run ```git clone "HTTPS:URL_VICAT_GOES_HERE"``, replacing the HTTPS link that was copied above.
6. This will download all of the contents of the ViCAT directory from GitHub in the structure seen in the [Repo](https://github.com/coryVkeith/ViCAT_dev).
7. Once the download is finished, you can navigate through the ViCAT directory to ensure the download was successful.
8. Instructions for running ViCAT are found in the [Repo](https://github.com/coryVkeith/ViCAT_dev).
9. Best of Luck!
